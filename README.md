## Background
I decided to make Archie because I thought it was annoying that chatbots like Cleverbot don't really have any personality of their own. Archie is meant to seem like an actual person you can talk to.
## Install
Press the run button in repl.it
## Usage
After entering your name and telling him your current mode Archie will be ready for whatever you throw at him.
